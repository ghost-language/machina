# Machine
_Name pending._

## Introduction
Machine provides a docker powered local development experience for Ghost that is compatible with macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux. Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using Machine. Machine's simple CLI means you can start building Ghost applications without any previous Docker experience.

## Inspiration
Machine is inspired by and derived from [Laravel Sail](https://github.com/laravel/sail) by [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell) and [Vessel](https://github.com/shipping-docker/vessel) by [Chris Fidao](https://github.com/fideloper).
