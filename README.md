# Machina

## Introduction
Machina provides a docker powered local development experience for Ghost that is compatible with macOS, Windows (WSL2), and Linux. Other than Docker, no software or libraries are required to be installed on your local computer before using Machina. Machina's simple CLI means you can start building Ghost applications without any previous Docker experience.

## Inspiration
Machina is inspired by and derived from [Laravel Sail](https://github.com/laravel/sail) by [Taylor Otwell](https://github.com/taylorotwell) and [Vessel](https://github.com/shipping-docker/vessel) by [Chris Fidao](https://github.com/fideloper). If you're looking for a thorough introduction to Docker, checkout out Chris' course: [Shipping Docker](https://serversforhackers.com/shipping-docker).
